This is an android app built with cordova

If you new to cordova it is really easy to getting started with following documentation

https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/

So basically, in this project you dont have to setup anything. All required dependencies are pre-installed

But you need to have installed cordova CLI to test the app

npm install -g cordova

after you installed cordova cli globally, Go to your cordova project folder and open with CMD

and plug your android device to PC and run following command

cordova run android

if you want to run in emulator (But this app requires camera to capture image. In most cases you cant test this app in an emulator)

cordova emulate android

To build the app

cordova build

When building the app make sure you follow cordova documentation.
